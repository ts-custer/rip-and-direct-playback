# rip-and-direct-playback

A simple Bash script to record internet radio (aka "stream ripping") and playback the ripped audio file immediately. 

The names of the ripped audio files contain a timestamp and the radio station name, e.g. `2021-12-09_16-15-00 New Classical FM.mp3`. The audio files will be stored in a new created subfolder "recordings". So after you have stopped **rip-and-direct-playback** you can listen to them again (or delete them of course)!

## Prerequisites

The following need to be installed:
* tr
* sed
* wget
* screen
* vlc

## Usage

Edit `internet_radios.txt` with a text editor, enter the radio stations of your choice.

Make `rip_and_direct_playback.sh`, `stream_address_finder.sh` and `print_internet_radios.sh` executable: 
```
$ chmod +x rip_and_direct_playback.sh
$ chmod +x stream_address_finder.sh
$ chmod +x print_internet_radios.sh
```

Start **rip-and-direct-playback**:
```
$ ./rip_and_direct_playback.sh internet_radios.txt
```

**rip-and-direct-playback** will present you the following options:

```
s) Print stations
r) Restart playback
-) Select previous station
q) Quit
