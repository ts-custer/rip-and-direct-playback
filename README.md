# rip-and-direct-playback

A simple Bash script to record internet radio (aka "stream ripping") and playback the ripped audio file immediately. 

The names of the ripped audio files contain a timestamp and the radio station name, e.g. `2021-12-09_16-15-00 New Classical FM.mp3`. The audio files will be stored in a new created subfolder "recordings". So after you have stopped **rip-and-direct-playback** you can listen to them again (or delete them of course)!
